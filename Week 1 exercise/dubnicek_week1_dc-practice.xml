    <dc:description>The thrid studio album from Compton, California-born rapper Kendrick Lamar. This album was 
        the anticipated follow-up to his 2012 "Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City." "To Pimp A Butterfly" was critically 
        lauded, winning album of the year for 2015 from reputable outlets such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and 
        Pitchfork. Considered both timely and enlightening, the album discusses a number of personal and societal 
        issues Lamar was interested in, such as African-American culture, race and racism in the United States, 
        institutionalized racism, and survivors guilt. The album was certified platinum in 2016, and won 4 Grammy awards.</dc:description>
